Alex Moreau — a talented and passionate software engineer — went missing.
He was brilliant, obsessive about security, and loved to share random thoughts about code on social media. 
Through our investigation, we found a small Twitter account "@alex_echoess" that seems to belong to him. The account is quiet — almost too quiet — but his  replies beneath it seem unusual.We believe Alex tried to send a message before he disappeared. could u find it ?
